However, it can apply to many other kinds of decision making situations, big and small, from \"What should I make for dinner?\" to \"Should I interview for this job?\" This process is useful even for topics you don't even want a single correct answer for, like \"Who is the best cat?\"",

The council is just images of beings from various public domain image sources, like The British Library and the Library of Congress. Each choice is presented by a different council member. It's like when NPCs in a video game like Baldur's Gate II or King of Dragon Pass all pipe up with advice for you! Hopefully, this changes your perspective a little, or at least makes your possible choices easier to read.",
