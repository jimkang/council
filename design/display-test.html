        We want to get one for our basement space. Durable and non-flimsy-feeling is our first-priority. This is more important than features. We understand that they're expensive and are preparing to accept that. Other requirement: It has to work with a regular domestic 120V power outlet, not a commercial one.

  Buy one from Craigslist - offer 1/2 what they are asking. People buy them and never use them. My Life Fitness had 10 miles on it and I got it for $125. There were asking $225.</div>

        <div class="dialogue-text">If you go read the Runner's World forum they are very harsh on ProForm. However, I had a ProForm for ten years (a low end, folding model) that I ran into the ground. 
<br />
So when it was time for a new treadmill, I ended up with another one and I love it. I bought their Boston Marathon treadmill. It took forever to ship. It weighs a ton - 3 people struggled to get it set up (didn't need much assembly but the deck weighs a billion pounds). I love it. It inclines, it declines, I bought an iFit subscription and can program my own interval training. 
<br />

It goes up to 15mph. I don't, so lots of room there. 
<br />

The no side rails design is amazing. And yeah, it plugs right into a normal wall outlet.
<br />

Did I mention I love it?
